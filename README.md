# Digital Art Project

## Intro
As a software engineer, you've been tasked to create a CRUD API for managing digital art

## Tech Stack
- React
- ExpressJS
- NodeJS
- PostgreSQL

## Prep
If you haven't already, install Docker and npm.

_Note: check the end of this Readme for Docker instructions._

_If you're using Windows 10 Home, there are important notes there too_

We need the node_modules folders locally, so after downloading this repo, first run
```
cd server && npm install && cd ..
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

To run & develop the applications, run:
```
docker-compose up â€”-build
# or for windows 10 home, use this instead:
# docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.win10.yaml up --build
```
The Express & React app will live reload on each file save.

To stop the app & erase the database, run:
```
docker-compose down
```

For macOS, Windows 10 Pro:

_The Express app is running at http://localhost:3100_

_The React SPA is running at http://localhost:3000_


For Windows 10 Home:

_The Express app is running at http://192.168.99.100:3100_

_The React SPA is running at http://192.168.99.100:3000_


## Database Access
To access the app database:
`psql postgres://user:pass@localhost:35432/db`

The test database can be accessed via:
`psql postgres://user:pass@localhost:35432/db_test`

## Tests
In order to access the test database during your testing you need to run these commands from within the docker container. This can be done by running: 

`docker-compose run server bash`

Both the server and frontend directories can be tested by running `yarn test` within either directory.


## Challenge
1. Create a CRUD RESTful API for the Art, using Express and PostgreSQL
Define an Art table for Postgres. An `Art` model should contain: name of the art, artist, description, width, height, and date created

  - Define HTTP endpoints for art, to allow:
    - Create: create a new piece of art
      input: name, artist, description, width, height, and date create
      output: the newly created art object
    - Read: read a piece of art
      input: id
      output: art object
    - Update: update a piece of art's name or description
      input: id, name, description
      output: updated art object
    - Delete: delete a piece of art
      input: id

2. Create a React front end to consume the API

  - Style/Design does not matter at all, feel free to use minimal or no CSS
  - This front end should consume each API event you created
    - Create: create a button which sends random data for each required field, or use a form for user inputed data, 
      whichever is easier/quicker for you
    - Read: display a list of all current pieces of art (anyway you want)
    - Update: allow the user to update an item in the list's title or description
    - Delete: allow the user to delete an item in the list

3. Write tests using a Javascript test framework of your choice to validate the API events
Write tests for each CRUD event you've written, that show they work as expected.

## Additional Questions
1. Each digital art file is a PNG, how would you save and serve this file from the API
to the client? How could you use AWS to do this? How would you modify the API/Data Model
you've created? (Answer in <500 words).
  - When adding the ability to save/serve PNG files from the API to the client I would likely use a library like [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) to handle `multipart/form` data via a file upload button and save the files to the disk. If I had access to AWS S3, I would change the API from saving things on the disk to saving them on a s3 bucket. This could be done in a very similar way to Multer on the frontend but rather than saving the file to the disk, we would set up a method to save the file to our s3 bucket and consume files from our s3 bucket for displaying the images of our art.

2. Write a description of a system design you would use for this app. How would you deploy this app to
production? Feel free to dig into anything you have experience with. (Answer in <500 words)
  - If I were designing this system for production, I would add a user management and authentication layer so that we can restrict accss to our application and db. I would most likely deploy this application to AWS and maybe even refactor it to use serverless to save costs. The build pipeline would most likely consist of a CI/CD tool spinning up the docker environment on pull requests to the codebase in GitHub and running the tests as well as the formatter/linter, then upon success and approval/merge, use something like deploybot to deploy the code to AWS.

## Appendix: Docker
Docker will allow you to create the nodejs app, database, and front end in one line,
`docker-compose up`. The provided docker-compose.yaml file already has many things done for you
already - networking, db credentials, live code reload for the express and react apps, etc).

### Installing Docker - macOS and Windows 10 Pro
macOS, Windows 10 Pro: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
(This includes Docker and docker-compose)

Running the app
```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Installing Docker - Windows 10 Home
Windows 10 Home: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/
(This includes Docker and docker-compose)

Running the app

_Note: If you're using Windows 10 Home, run the app with the follow command instead_
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.win10.yaml up --build
```

Docker Toolbox has a few differences from Docker Desktop, which that file takes care of for you.

Additionally
- Instead of http://localhost:3000, the front end is available at http://192.168.99.100:3000
- Instead of http://localhost:3100, the server API is available at http://192.168.99.100:3100
- For volumes to work, your code must be in a sub-folder of C:/Users/ (https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/#optional-add-shared-directories)
